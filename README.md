# plant-diary


## Introduction

My Plant Diary allows homeowners to maintain records on plants in their yard.  They can upload photos and add notes to a plant at any time.  Plant data, including sustainability and edibility, are sourced from PlantPlaces.com master data.

Users can generate a report to show several attributes of their yard: sustainability, edibility, native, etc.  This report can be used to help sell the positive attributes of the house.

Users can interact with MyPlantDiary using either a set of RESTful service endpoints, or a simple UI, or both.
